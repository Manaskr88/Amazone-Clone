# Amazone-Clone
Web Clone of Amazon using HTML & CSS

Hello everyone, I am excited to share my latest project with you all. I have created a web clone of Amazon using HTML and CSS! 💻🚀
This project was a great opportunity for me to practice and improve my front-end development skills. I was able to implement various design elements, such as navigation bars, product cards, and a responsive layout.
I would love to hear any feedback or suggestions you may have. Thank you for taking the time to check out my project! 🙏
